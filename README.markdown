__OpenCV computer vision with iOS: stitching panoramas__  

<img src = "https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVSwiftStitch/blob/meta/meta/example.big.jpg">

Version 2.0 of [OpenCVStitch](http://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch)

This project was created to a answer a couple of Stack Overflow questions:  
[libraries to CAPTURE panorama in iOS](http://stackoverflow.com/q/14062932/1375695)  
[Can I mix Swift with C++? Like the Objective - C .mm files](http://stackoverflow.com/q/24042774/1375695)    

v2 demonstrates how to mix Swift, Objective-C and C++ in one project whilst keeping the code clearly separate. 

The project AppDelegate and View Controller are written in Swift. Swift cannot talk directly to C++ (which we need for OpenCV), so we provide an Objective-C++ wrapper class to mediate between Swift and C++. We also provide an Objective-C++ category on UIImage to mediate between UIImage and CV::Mat image formats. The CVWrapper header file is pure Objective-C. For [v1](https://github.com/foundry/OpenCVStitch)(which doesn't use Swift) this separation was a matter of clean style. For v2, it is a requirement: if any C++ headers are included in the wrapper, the app will not compile (Swift won't like it).

__Installation__  
To run the project you need to install the OpenCV framework:    
v3.0.0: available from [opencv.org](http://opencv.org)  
v2.4.9: installed via cocoaPods

v3.0.0: download the framework and drag it to your project. Include it in the _Link Binary With Libraries_ section of Build Phases for the target.  
v2.4.9: Assuming you have first [installed CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), run 'pod install' in this directory to install OpenCV for the project. From then on, always open the project in XCode from the `SwiftStitch.xcworkspace` file that the pod install creates. 

__Use__  
OpenCVStitch is a very simple iOS/openCV example showing basic use of the Stitcher class. The c++ code is adapted from a sample included with the openCV distribution.  

The app has almost no user interface. On launch, the stitching code operates on four sample images, displaying the result in a UIScrollView.

__OpenCV Versions__  
_OpenCV 3.x_   
OpenCV 3.0.0 has just been released. There is no podspec avaiable, but the framework _does_ just work if you download from http://opencv.org and drag into the project. No need for cocoaPods with this version, and the stitching runs 85% faster on my iphone 5s - but seems to produce less accurate results.

_OpenCV 2.4.x_  
The openCV distribution is not as clean as we would like.  
2.4.10 - the pod spec and the distribution build for iOS [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28331397/cocoapods-opencv-2-4-10-linker-error/28820510)  
2.4.9 - the pod spec [is broken](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31005022/cant-install-opencv-with-cocoapods-could-not-resolve-host-hivelocity-dl-sourc). This is likely a result of relying on Sourceforge for hosting.  

Therefore we are using a [self-hosted podspec](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV) (_thanks Matteo!_) until official channels are fixed. Specs are available for [2.4.9](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.9-zp) and [2.4.10](https://github.com/Zi0P4tch0/Specs/tree/master/Specs/OpenCV/2.4.10-zp), but as the latter won't run we use 2.4.9.

_this version of OpenCVStitch opted to use cocoapods to overcome the [notorious](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13905471/1375695) [installation](http://stackoverflow.com/q/15855894/1375695) [issues](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14186883/1375695) with previous versions of the openCV 2.4.x framework.. it seems our optimism was slightly premature!_

__XCode 7__  

The project is not yet updated for XCode 7, so there are minor issues that you may encounter with XCode 7, ios9 and Swift 2. In particular, if you open the project in XCode 7, you will be asked if you want to convert to the latest Swift syntax. You do _not_ have to do this to run the project. If you _do_ convert, the update will also turn on Bitcode. Then the project will not compile, as the openCV framework is not bitcode-enabled. 

You can disable Bitcode by setting the projects's build settings->build options->Enable Bitcode switch to NO.
